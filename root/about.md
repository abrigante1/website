I'm Anthony Avancena-Brigante, an Audio Programmer passionate about empowering Audio Designers to realize their creative visions; whether that's by developing dynamic music systems, integrating the latest audio technologies, or building custom tools to streamline workflows and reduce implementation friction. My goal is always to make a Designer's job easier and more enjoyable

Most recently, I contributed to an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, working closely with a small team of audio engineers. Together, we developed innovative audio solutions and empowered Audio Designers to iterate rapidly within a brand new cutting-edge game engine and tools ecosystem.
